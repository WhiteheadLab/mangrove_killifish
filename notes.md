# Downloading raw data off ncbi
Following instructions on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK158899/#SRA_download.when_to_use_a_command_line
First to see if wget works for a single read

```
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByRun/sra/SRR/SRR692/SRR6926018/SRR6926018.sra
```

Worked as expected but downloaded file as a .sra which makes sense
Don't know what file type it should be downloaded as (maybe .gz?)
